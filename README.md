# Dynamic-Express-Router
A dynamic express router that reads paths out of a file. Useful for APIs.

# THIS IS A REALLY DUMB IDEA
Don't ever use this in production! This is a security risk, a dumb idea in general, but someone annoyed me that he wanted a dynamic router.. So I've written one.. Yeah my life is f-ing boring.

You can dynamically route to JS Files with this, but please dont. It only allows one protocoll (POST, DELETE AND PATCH - DONT EVER USE GET IN AN API!)

# Usage
This is dangerous! Figure it out by yourself and try to understand coding if you think _this_ is a good idea..
